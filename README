Game of Derp is dedicated to my husband Daniel, who is invariably the derpiest of all humans.

NOTE: This game is an exercise as part of Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way, ex 45. This is also my first time writing
code on my own. I appreciate all feedback anyone would be willing to give, but please be gentle.

Game of Derp tells the story of an old, crotchity man named Murf, who is thrusted into an alternate universe
where there is much happiness, stupidity, and pie. Murf, a pessimist by nature, seeks to uncover the truth to the land
called Poof.
